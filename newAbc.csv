No more we see him on the stamp ; Our only chance is when we camp. But he is shy, and when he goes A-swimming, you can see his nose, And nothing more except his track. If he ’s alarmed, a mighty smack Of his flat tail, and he ’s gone clean, Like any other submarine.","CHINOOK UP goes the mercury, Away goes the snow, Off go overcoats When chinooks blow.","DAULAC WHEN their canoes left Montreal They knew that they would not come back; But they were proud to give their all For France and die beside Daulac. Eight times day slowly dimmed to night; Eight times night slowly wore to day ; While at Long Sault they fought their fight, And held the Iroquois at bay.","EXPLORERS COLD, want, and hunger could not turn Them back from their great quest— Mackenzie, Henry Hudson, Hearne— Till utmost north and west, Forest and lake and far-spread plain, Arctic and western sea Surrendered to Franklin and Champlain, Kelsey, Laverendrye.","FATHER POINT IT ’s there you drop the pilot When you are outward-bound ; It ’s there they have a foghorn Of strange and doleful sound ; It ’s there you start to wonder Just how you ’re going to be Next day, when you ’re surrounded By nothing but the sea. But when you ’re headed westward, And the sea is all behind, There you pick up the pilot, And Father Point seems kind.","GRAIN WHEAT for the English bakers And oats that are soon to be rolled, Thousands and thousands of acres Covered with prairie gold.","HUDSON BAY COMPANY TWAS Charles the Second gave the charter Allowing them to trade and barter, And they have done so ever since That generous and merry prince Gave their wide powers and mighty sway To the Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson Bay.","INDIANS ABOUT four hundred, years ago They first looked on a white man’s And welcomed him, and did not know That one day he would take their place. They still are here, but their fierce pride And wild free life have passed away ; Another race has thrust aside The children of a bygone day.","JESUITS TO light dark Indian souls they came, And suffered for their dear Faith’s sake; They passed unflinching to the flame; They stood unconquered at the stake.","KICKING HORSE PASS THE thing, some said, could not be done, But pluck and brains persisted till Through that wild pass the rails were run, And it was conquered by man’s will.","LAKES THERE are five Great Lakes, all deep and wide, And when the wind makes a commotion, If you ’re on shipboard, your inside Will feel the same as on the ocean.","MOUNTIES THEY came before the railways came, And to the west brought law and order. They ’ve won themselves a right fair name From Herschel Island to the border.","NIAGARA WHAT a great thing to have been First of white men to have seen Niagara, and stood in wonder At the water’s rush and thunder ! Father Hennepin saw that show Two centuries and a half ago, But, though we can’t feel quite his thrill, The Falls are strange and mighty still.","OTTAWA TO Ottawa from coast to coast The chosen come to make the laws. For weeks they talk about a lot Of different things with scarce a pause : The railway line to Hudson Bay, Taxes and tariff, immigration, The great St. Lawrence waterway, And whether we are yet a nation.","PRAIRIES THE prairies stretch from Winnipeg To where the foothills start, The pioneer jogged all that way In a slow Red River cart.","QUEBEC THE Indians lived there, then the French, And last the English came; Three hundred years of history Are wrapped up in the name.","RIVERS BIG and small, swift and slow, North, south, east and west they flow Fraser, Red, Saskatchewan, Tobique, Saguenay, St. John, Peace, Mackenzie, Montreal, Great St. Lawrence, king of all.","SUGAR IT's not the kind you put in tea, But what comes from the maple tree When men go out in Spring and tap The trunks and catch the fresh sweet sap, Which, after proper boiling, makes Brown maple sugar in hard cakes ; And all one maple tree can do Is to make just a pound or two.","TUMP ""WHEN the portage is long and the footing is rough, And the load on your back weighs far more than enough, When each muscle has its own separate ache, And mosquitoes are with you each step that you take, The tump seems a tyrant.

2638,"Moral Alphabet, A",1899,"A stands for Archibald who told no lies, And got this lovely volume for a prize. The Upper School had combed and oiled their hair, And all the Parents of the Boys were there, In words that ring like thunder through the Hall, Draw tears from some and loud applause from all, - The Pedagogue, with Pardonable Joy, Bestows the Gift upon the Radiant Boy :— Accept the Noblest Work produced as yet'
(Says he) “upon the English Alphabet;
“ Next term I shall examine you, to find “
If you have read it thoroughly. So mind ! And while the Boys and Parents cheered so loud, That out of doors a large and anxious crowd Had gathered and was blocking up the street, The admirable child resumed his seat. Moral. Learn from this justly irritating Youth, To brush your Hair and Teeth and tell the Truth.","B stands for Bear. When Bears arc seen Approaching in the distance. Make up your mind at once between Retreat and Armed Resistance. A Gentleman remained to fight— With what result for him ? The Bear, with ill-concealed delight, Devoured him, Limb by Limb. Another Person turned and ran ; He ran extremely hard : The Bear was faster than the Man, And beat him by a yard. Moral. Decisive action in the hour of need Denotes the Hero, but does not succeed.","C stands for Cobra ; when the Cobra bites An Indian Judge, the Judge spends restless nights. Moral. This creature, though disgusting and appalling. Conveys no kind of Moral worth recalling.","D The Dreadful Dinotherium he Will have to do his best for D. The early world observed with awe His back, indented like a saw. His look was gay, his voice was strong; His tail was neither short nor long; His trunk, or elongated nose, Was not so large as some suppose; His teeth, as all the world allows. Were graminivorous, like a cow's. He therefore should have wished to pass Long peaceful nights upon the Grass, But being mad the brute preferred To roost in branches, like a bird.* A creature heavier than a whale, You see at once, could hardly fail To suffer badly when he slid * We have good reason to suppose He did so, from his claw-like toes. And tumbled (as he always did). His fossil, therefore, comes to light All broken up : and serve him right. Moral. If you were born to walk the ground, Remain there ; do not fool around.",E stands for Egg. Moral. The Moral of this verse Is applicable to the Young. Be terse.,"F for a Family taking a walk In Arcadia Terrace, no doubt: The parents indulge in intelligent talk. While the children they gambol about. At a quarter-past six they return to their tea. Of a kind that would hardly be tempting to me, Though my appetite passes belief. There is Jam, Ginger Beer, Buttered Toast, Marmalade, With a Cold Leg of Mutton and Warm Lemonade, And a large Pigeon Pie very skilfully made To consist almost wholly of Beef. Moral. A Respectable Family taking the air Is a subject on which I could dwell; It contains all the morals that ever there were, And it sets an example as well.","G stands for Gnu, whose weapons of Defence Are long, sharp, curling Horns, and Common-sense. To these he adds a Name so short and strong. That even Hardy Boers pronounce it wrong. How often on a bright Autumnal day The Pious people of Pretoria say, “Come, let us hunt the--"" Then no more is heard But Sounds of Strong Men struggling with a word. Meanwhile, the distant Gnu with grateful eyes Observes his opportunity, and flies. Moral. Child, if you have a rummy kind of name, Remember to be thankful for the same.","H was a Horseman who rode to the meet, And talked of the Pads of the fox as his ""feet""— An error which furnished subscribers with grounds For refusing to make him a Master of Hounds. He gave way thereupon to so fearful a rage, That he sold up his Stable and went on the Stage, And had all the success that a man could desire In creating the Part of ""The Old English Squire."" Moral. In the Learned Professions, a person should know The advantage of having two strings to his bow.","I the Poor Indian, justly called ""The Poor,"" He has to eat his Dinner off the floor. Moral. The Moral these delightful lines afford Is : Living cheaply is its own reward.","J stands for James, who thought it immaterial To pay his taxes, Local or Imperial. In vain the Mother wept, the Wife implored, James only yawned as though a trifle bored. The Tax Collector called again, but he Was met with Persiflage and Repartee. When James was hauled before the learned Judge, Who lectured him, he loudly whispered, ""Fudge !"" The Judge was startled from his usual calm, He struck the desk before him with his palm, And roared in tones to make the boldest quail, J stands far James, it also STANDS FOR JAIL. And therefore, on a dark and dreadful day, Policemen came and took him all away. Moral. The fate of James is typical, and shows How little mercy people can expect Who will not pay their taxes; (saving those To which they conscientiously object.)","K for the Klondyke, a Country of Gold. Where the winters are often excessively cold; Where the town every morning is covered with rime. And skating continues for years at a time. Do you think that a Climate can conquer the grit Of the Sons of the West ? Not a bit ! Not a bit! When the weather looks nippy, the bold Pioneers Put on two pairs of Stockings and cover their ears, And roam through the drear Hyperborean dales With a vast apparatus of Buckets and Pails; Or wander through wild Hyperborean glades With Hoes, Hammers, Pickaxes, Mattocks and Spades. There are some who give rise to exuberant mirth By turning up nothing but bushels of earth. While those who have little cause excellent fun By attempting to pilfer from those who have none. At times the reward they will get for their pains Is to strike very tempting auriferous veins ; Or, a shaft being sunk for some miles in the ground, Not infrequently nuggets of value are found. They bring us the gold when their labours arc ended, And we—after thanking them prettily—spend it. MORAL. Just you work for Humanity, never you mind If Humanity seems to have left you behind.","L was a Lady, Advancing in Age, Who drove in her carriage and six, With a Couple of Footmen a Coachman and Page, Who were all of them regular bricks. If the Coach ran away, or was smashed by a Dray. Or got into collisions and blocks, The Page, with a courtesy rare for his years. Would leap to the ground with inspiriting cheers. While the Footman allayed her legitimate fears. And the Coachman sat tight on his box. At night as they met round an excellent meal, They would take it in turn to observe: What a Lady indeed! what a presence to feel ! . . What a Woman to worship and serve ! . . . But, perhaps, the most poignant of all their delights Was to stand in a rapturous Dream When she spoke to them kindly on Saturday Nights. And said ""They deserved her Esteem."" Moral. Now observe the Reward of these dutiful lives : At the end of their Loyal Career They each had a Lodge at the end of the drives, And she left them a Hundred a Year. Remember from this to be properly vexed When the newspaper editors say. That ""The type of society shown in the Text Is rapidly passing away.""","M was a Millionaire who sat at Table. And ate like this—as long as he was able ; At half-past twelve the waiters turned him out : He lived impoverished and died of gout. Moral. Disgusting exhibition ! Have a care When, later on, you are a Millionaire, To rise from table feeling you could still Take something more, and not be really ill.","N stands for Ned. Maria's younger brother, Who, walking one way, chose to gaze the other. In Blandford Square—a crowded part of town— Two People on a tandem knocked him down ; Whereat a Motor Car, with warning shout, Ran right on top and turned him inside out The damages that he obtained from these Maintained him all his life in cultured ease. Moral The law protects you. Go your gentle way: The Other Man has always got to Pay.","O stands for Oxford. Hail ! salubrious seat Of learning ! Academical Retreat! Home of my Middle Age ! Malarial Spot Which People call Medeeval (though it's not). The marshes in the neighbourhood can vie With Cambridge, but the town itself is dry, And serves to make a kind of Fold or Pen Wherein to herd a lot of Learned Men. Were I to write but half of what they know, It would exhaust the space reserved for ""O""; And, as my book must not be over big. I turn at once to "" P,” which stands for Pig. Moral. Be taught by this to speak with moderation Of places where, with decent application, One gets a good, sound, middle-class education.","P stands for Pig, as I remarked before. A second cousin to the Huge Wild Boar. But Pigs arc civilized, while Huge Wild Boars Live savagely, at random, out of doors. And, in their coarse contempt for dainty foods, Subsist on Truffles, which they find in woods. Not so the cultivated Pig, who feels The need of several courses at his meals. But wrongly thinks it docs not matter whether He takes them one by one or all together. Hence, Pigs devour, from lack of self-respect, What Epicures would certainly reject. Moral. Learn from the Pig to take whatever Fate Or Elder Persons heap upon your plate.","Q for Quinine, which children take With Jam and little bits of cake. Moral. How idiotic ! Can Quinine Replace Cold Baths and Sound Hygiene ?","R the Reviewer. reviewing my book, At which he had barely intended to look ; But the very first lines upon ""A"" were enough To convince him the Verses were excellent stuff. So he wrote, without stopping, for several days In terms of extreme, but well-merited Praise. To quote but one Passage : "" No Person "" (says he), Will be really content without purchasing three,
While a Parent will send for a dozen or more, And strew them about on the Nursery Floor.
The Versification might call for some strictures Were it not for its singular wit; while the Pictures,
Tho' the handling of line is a little defective, Make up amply in verve what they lack in perspective. Moral. The habit of constantly telling the Truth Will lend an additional lustre to Youth.","S stands for Snail, who, though he be the least, Is not an uninstructive Horned Beast. His eyes are on his Horns, and when you shout Or tickle them, the Horns go in and out. Had Providence seen proper to endow The furious Unicorn or sober Cow With such a gift the one would never now Appear so commonplace on Coats of Arms. And what a fortune for our failing farms If circus managers, with wealth untold, Would take the Cows for half their weight in gold ! Moral. Learn from the Snail to take reproof with patience. And not put out your Horns on all occasions.","T for the Genial Tourist, who resides In Peckham, where he writes Italian Guides. Moral. Learn from this information not to cavil At slight mistakes in books on foreign travel.","U for the Upas Tree, that casts a blight On those that pull their sisters' hair, and fight. But oh ! the Good ! They wander undismayed, And (as the Subtle Artist has portrayed) Dispend the golden hours at play beneath its shade.* Moral. Dear Reader, if you chance to catch a sight Of Upas Trees, betake yourself to flight. * A friend of mine, a botanist, believes That Good can even browse upon its leaves. I doubt it. . . .","V for the unobtrusive Volunteer, Who fills the Armies of the World with fear. Moral. Seek with the Volunteer to put aside The empty Pomp of Military Pride.","W My little victim, let me trouble you To fix your active mind on W. The WATERBEETLE here shall teach A sermon far beyond your reach : He flabbergasts the Human Race By gliding on the water's face With ease, celerity, and grace ; But if he ever stopped to think Of how he did it, he would sink. Moral. Don't ask Questions!",X No reasonable little Child expects A Grown-up Man to make a rhyme on X. Moral. These verses teach a clever child to find Excuse for doing all that he's inclined.,"Y stands for Youth (it would have stood for Yak, But that I wrote about him two years back). Youth is the pleasant springtime of our days, As Dante so mellifluously says (Who always speaks of Youth with proper praise). You have not got to Youth, but when you do You'll find what He and 1 have said is true. Moral. Youth’s excellence should teach the Modern Wit First to be Young, and then to boast of it.","Z for this Zébu, who (like all Zebús)* Is held divine by scrupulous Hindoos. * Von Kettner writes it ""Zébu""; Wurst ""Zebu"": I split the difference and use the two. Moral. Idolatry, as you are well aware, Is highly reprehensible. But there. We needn't bother,—when we get to Z Our interest in the Alphabet is dead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3534,"American ABC, An",1941,A is for America The land I love,"B is for BELL Our Liberty Bell It is a huge, proud bell older than our United States. The great bell was made in London for the colony of Pennsylvania. It was brought to America and hung in the State House at Philadelphia. Once, long ago, this bell pealed out a message of great importance. It was the news that the American colonies were to be forever free and independent. The State House in Philadelphia later came to be called Independence Hall, and is still the home of the Liberty Bell. Here, honored and loved, it stands in state today, and reminds us of our good fortune.","C is for COLUMBUS Christopher Columbus Christopher Columbus was an Italian sailor who was born before America was known. This sailor had a strange idea. As he watched ships disappear far out over the ocean’s edge, he said, ""The earth must be round like a ball."" And so he believed that although India was a country to the east he could reach it by sailing to the west. But all the people laughed! Columbus was so sure he was right that when he could get no help in his own country he went to Spain. The Spanish queen at last gave him three tiny vessels and he set sail for India. After many, many weeks the little sailing ships reached the shores of a strange land where only red men lived. Here was a new world, the land to be called North and South America. Columbus believed he had reached India. Columbus returned home and told the wonderful things he had seen. Then other daring men ventured to cross the seas and seek their fortunes in this New World.","D is for DANIEL BOONE A trailmaker in this new country Much of the New World was a wilderness covered with forests. It was the home of tribes of redskins with tomahawks and war paint. Only the bravest and strongest of the white men could live here. The white men and women who first settled this country were called pioneers. One of the most fearless pioneers was Daniel Boone. He could hunt as well as the red man, and he could ride and run as fast and as far. Daniel Boone left his log-cabin home near the sea and pushed his way through deep forests where no white man had ever set foot. He went on and on into the wilderness. He made trails into unknown parts of the country. The settlers and their families followed after Daniel Boone. They cut clearings in the forest and they built log cabins. They planted fields and made new homes along the trails. And so Daniel Boone helped to make this country grow.","E is for EMIGRANTS People who leave their own land to make new homes in another land Emigrants from all the different countries of the world journeyed to this new land. Our great-great-grandfathers, our grandfathers, even perhaps our fathers, were all emigrants to America. Some came to seek their fortunes. Many were unhappy in their own countries and came here to escape ways of living which had been forced upon them. They left their homes in the Old World and came to find homes in the New. They came to America because this country stood for Freedom. People from all over the world are still coming to our shores. Good emigrants make true Americans.","F is for FREEDOM That precious thing for which America stands Those men and women who were the first settlers in America came here to find freedom. Freedom means the right to believe and to live as one thinks best, and the right to worship God in one’s own way. The early settlers had to struggle to make their new land free and their descendants have always fought to preserve that freedom. Today it is the will of every American to keep our country the Land of the Free.","G is for GEORGE WASHINGTON The Father of his country One of the greatest of the men who worked for America’s freedom was George Washington. He was the son of a rich planter in Virginia. As a young surveyor he rode long miles through dense forests with his compass and his gun. As a young soldier he was sent out to defend the frontier against attacks by the Indians. Later, when the American colonists knew that they would have to fight for their independence, he was made Commander in Chief of the army. General Washington was fearless and wise. He was just and strong and was loved and trusted by all his followers. He was a leader in the making of this great new nation After independence was won, the people chose him as the first President of the United States of America.","H is for HENRY HUDSON A brave sea captain Henry Hudson sailed the sea in the days when only the red men lived in this country. He crossed the ocean and explored the shores of the New World. In the Half Moon, a tiny Dutch sailing vessel with its prow built high out of the water, he found the mouth of a river and sailed far up between its banks. He explored northern waters which were blocked with ice and fog. On his last voyage to America there was mutiny on his ship, and an angry crew put the brave captain and his son in a tiny open boat and left it locked in icy waters. Henry Hudson and his son were never seen again, but from his daring voyages the people of the Old World had learned much about America. They had heard of the river later called the Hudson River and of the great northern bay and the straits which bear the name of this brave explorer.","I is for INDEPENDENCE The Declaration of Independence The many colonies established in America were governed from the Old World. Fearless men of the colonies believed that the rulers, who lived so far away, were unjust and did not understand this New World. They resolved that the colonies must be independent and have the right to govern themselves even if it meant fighting for this right. In July, 1776, the great bell of the State House in Philadelphia rang out. Excited men and women gathered to listen to the first reading of a most important paper. This was the Declaration of Independence, prepared by young Thomas Jefferson of Virginia, a friend of George Washington. It proclaimed that the thirteen colonies were to be free and independent. People shouted for joy as they listened to the courageous words. Valiant leaders from all the colonies boldly signed this Declaration of Independence. They pledged their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor to its support.","J is for JAMESTOWN A colony in Virginia In the early days of America, a company in London sent out a group of men to found a colony in Virginia. These colonists reached the coast of Virginia. They sailed up a river and settled on its shores and called the little settlement Jamestown after the king of the country from which they had come. Most of the men were knights and gentlemen and merchants of London who had come to seek their fortunes. They knew nothing of the hard work needed to found a colony in a strange new land. It was the great courage of a few that kept the little group alive. Captain John Smith was one of these strong leaders. When his colony was starving, it was he who found a way to get corn from the unfriendly Indians. After years of struggle the colony of Virginia grew steadily. From Virginia came many of those courageous and stalwart men who were the leaders and the builders of a great nation.","K is for KNICKERBOCKER The name of a family of early Dutch colonists Sturdy Dutchmen who heard about the river in America which Henry Hudson had explored also came to found a colony in this country. They settled on the island of Manhattan at the mouth of Hudson’s river. Here they built a stockade and a fort and traded with the Indians. The Dutch trading post grew to be the village of New Amsterdam, named by the Dutch after their much-loved city in Holland. New Amsterdam became a center of trade between the colonists and the Old World. When it passed into the hands of the English, it was renamed New York. Knickerbocker is the name of one of those Dutch families who settled here. Now we use this word when we talk of New York’s early history or the descendants of those early New Amsterdam settlers.","L is for LINCOLN Honest Abe Lincoln Abraham Lincoln was an American born in the poorest of log cabins. He grew up in the wilderness of Indiana where there were no schools. In the daytime the boy worked planting corn and cutting trees. At night he studied and by the light of the fire he read every book he could borrow. Lincoln became a wise lawyer. The people throughout the countryside loved and trusted him. He was fearless although he was always just and kind. He was chosen President at a time when America was in grave danger. He worked, and finally died, for two great causes —to free the Negroes from slavery, and to keep this country a united nation. In his famous Gettysburg Address he told his countrymen that they must see that this “government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.” Today, as in the past, this is the great and glorious task of every true American.","M is for MAYFLOWER The Pilgrim's ship It was the Pilgrims who founded one of the important colonies of the New World. They were people who had wandered from one country to another searching for a place where they could worship God in their own way. About one hundred of them, men, women, and children set out for America in a tiny ship named the Mayflower. After nine long weeks on the rough seas, it was nearly Christmastime when the ship reached the coast of New England. Here the Pilgrims landed, and the settlement of Plymouth was started. The Mayflower returned to England, leaving the little band of settlers in their new home. The Pilgrims suffered cruelly from cold and from hunger that first harsh winter, and only a few of the group survived. But their spirit was never broken, and the courage and the faith of those Pilgrims helped to build our country.","N is for NATIONAL ANTHEM The Star Spangled Banner When the United States was fighting on the seas, an American named Francis Scott Key was held prisoner on an enemy ship. That night the guns of this ship were firing on Fort McHenry. As the black sky was lighted up, the prisoner could see his country’s flag flying over the fort in the distance. The battle went on and on. Then the firing ceased and everything was still. Francis Scott Key waited in the darkness. At last the daylight came. His heart was full of joy as he saw his country’s flag still flying from the fort. It was then that he wrote the words of the great song “The Star Spangled Banner.” This song is now our National Anthem.","O is for OLD GLORY Our country’s flag When the thirteen colonies of America declared themselves independent states, they needed a flag of their own. It is said that General Washington drew a picture of a flag and took it to Betsy Ross, the wife of one of his soldiers. With her scissors Betsy Ross cut seven long strips of red cloth and six long strips of white, and sewed them together neatly. In one corner she placed a square patch of blue cloth. On the blue square she carefully sewed thirteen white stars in the form of a circle. There was a stripe and a star for each of the colonies. A star has been added for each new state as it came into the Union. Today the American flag still has the thirteen stripes but there are forty-eight stars in the blue square.","P is for PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The salute to our flag This is the promise of loyalty to our country which is in the heart of every true American. “I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.”","Q is for QUAKERS And Quakers are Friends Among the early settlers of our country were the Quakers. One of the greatest Quakers was William Penn. He founded the colony of Pennsylvania and laid out Philadelphia, which means the City of Brotherly Love. Penn made a treaty with the Indians which was kept so faithfully that the Quaker colony and the Indians were always at peace. The Quakers are sometimes called Friends. They are friendly toward all people and have always been ready to help anyone suffering or in trouble no matter who he may be or in what country he may live. The friendly Quakers believe in the simple way of living. They are a people who believe in peace.","R for REDSKINS The first real Americans When Columbus reached America he thought he had found India and so he called the red-skinned people of the country Indians. Long before the coming of the white men, tribes of redskins with their families were living in America. Their land was taken from them as more and more white men settled here. Many of the tribes were hostile, but there were friendly Indians too. Squanto was one of the friendly redskins. He brought the Pilgrims corn to eat during that first winter when they were starving. W'hen spring came and “the oak leaves were the size of a mouse’s ear,"" Squanto taught the Pilgrims to bury a fish with the kernels of corn they planted so that the stalks would grow more quickly. He taught the hungry Pilgrim children how to tread the stream for eels, which they could cook and eat. The redskins or Indians of North and South America were the first real Americans.","S is for SOUTH AMERICA and for Simon Bolivar In this New World which Columbus found there are two great continents, the continents of North America and South America. The southern America also struggled and won its freedom just as did North America. Simon Bolivar was one of the great leaders who helped to win this independence for South America. Today South America is made up of republics which believe in liberty and the rights of people. These republics are governed by laws much like those of the United States in North America. The nations of these two neighboring continents have now come together in an All-American Union, a Pan American Union for peace and friendship and help to one another.","T is for THANKSGIVING A day set aside to give thanks The Pilgrims gave us Thanksgiving. After they had gathered their first harvest in this country, they rejoiced to find they had plenty for the coming winter. Governor Bradford, the head of this little New England colony, invited the friendly Indian chief and his braves to come and celebrate with them. Together they feasted on corn and pumpkins, on wild turkey, and on the deer which the Indians brought from the forest. This first Thanksgiving lasted three days, for the hearts of the Pilgrims were full of thankfulness to God. It was President Lincoln who first declared Thanksgiving a holiday. Each November a special day is set aside by the government for us to give thanks for the many good things we have in America. is for the UNITED STATES Our United States of America.","U is for the UNITED STATES Our United States of America When the thirteen colonies declared themselves independent states, the United States of America was formed. The early leaders drew up wise rules of government for this new nation which they called the American Constitution. This Constitution is still the basis of our government, a government founded on truth, on justice, and on the rights of men. The United States of America now contains forty-eight states and the two territories of Hawaii and Alaska. It is today a great nation reaching from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. Facing the sea in the harbor of New York, stands the bronze Statue of Liberty. This welcoming figure with a torch in her upraised hand is a symbol of the American spirit.","V is for VALLEY FORGE and the valor of our soldiers During the war for freedom and independence, General George Washington and his soldiers were encamped for the winter at Valley Forge, a small village near Philadelphia. The soldiers had but little food and were poorly equipped. Some were without shoes and coats and lived in rough huts built of boughs. The shivering soldiers gathered around the campfires to keep from freezing. But these men had great courage and valor. Day after day in the snow and cold they faithfully drilled and made ready for the coming battles. They were fighting for the independence of their country. It was the valor of men like these at Valley Forge that won freedom for America.","W is for WHITE HOUSE and the city of Washington, the home of our government The President is the head of the government of the United States. While he is in office he lives in the city of Washington, our nation's capital. The President’s home is called the White House and is a large stone house painted white. It is surrounded with beautiful green lawns and great trees. All the Presidents of our country except George Washington have lived at the White House. But even our first President helped to plan this home, and the city which is named for him. The city of Washington is in the District of Columbia. It has many fine government buildings and very beautiful parks. Broad avenues lead up to the capitol building. Here on the steps of the Capitol our President takes the oath of office and promises to preserve, to protect, and to defend the Constitution of the United States of America.","X is for XMAS and Xmas means Christmas This great holiday is a day of joy and happiness for all the Christian world. The first Christmas came to pass long ago when in Bethlehem a glowing star suddenly appeared in the heavens. That night the Christ Child was born and a joyful message was sent to all the world: “Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace, good will toward men.” Each year, on December twenty-fifth, we celebrate the birthday of the Christ Child and recall the great Christmas message which is a part of the spirit of America.","Y is for YANKEE DOODLE A song of the early soldiers The first American soldiers were men who gathered quickly from towns and fields and frontiers of all the many colonies. They were untrained soldiers. Few had uniforms and all had poor equipment. They made a strange-looking army. Someone wrote a song making fun of these early soldiers. It was called “Yankee Doodle” and the words were sung to an old, old tune: ‘Yankee Doodle came to town, Riding on a pony; He stuck a feather in his hat And called it macaroni.” The soldiers took this song as their own and proudly sang it as they marched. “Yankee Doodle” became the much-loved song of those staunch early Americans, and we still sing it today.",Z is for ZEAL An American trait It was zeal which made navigators of old voyage over dangerous seas and find this New World. It was zeal that gave the early settlers the strength and the courage to build their homes in the great wilderness of a strange new land. It was zeal that kept the colonies together and won for them their independence. It is this same zeal that will keep America a great land and a land of liberty and freedom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That her reign may he happy, and useful, and long. Q begins Quarrel - one angry word, And oh, what a host of had passions are stirred! Quill, that papa can make into a pen, And with it write letters to dear brother Ben. Quince, a nice fruit, like a large yellow pear, That grows on a tree now become very rare. Quagga, an animal; Quail, a plump bird, Whose cry in the springtime we sometimes have heard. Quarry, a pit where they dig out the stone, Just down by the hill-side, so barren and lone.

Rush, that the marshes and damp places fills. Ravine, a deep hollow pass in the hills. Ruth, the good maiden of whom you will read Some day in God's book - a sweet story indeed.","S begins Slave. Who can look, without pain, On that agonized face, and that whip, and that chain? Squirrel, that acorns and nuts loves to hide, String, with which Susan's great bandbox was tied. Shell - on the beach what a number we found! Spade, papa uses to dig up the ground. Swan, that so gracefully floats on the stream. Sun, that arises with silvery beam. Strawberry, too, a soft fruit very sweet. Shoes, papa buys me to wear on my feet, Sleep, for dear baby; and Shed, for the Sheep, Sickle, a round knife, with which the men reap. Spectacles, like grandma wears on her nose. Snowdrop, the earliest spring flower that blows. Ship, a large vessel that sails on the Sea. Slate - mamma says she will buy one for me. Sunday, the day when in God's house we bow. Stool, like Jane sits on, when milking the cow. Scissors, we cut with: Sieve, Sermon, and Shower. And Sceptre, well known as the emblem of power.","T begins Tunnel, through which went the Train That brought Uncle Thomas and me back again. Ticket - the guard did not ask me for mine. Telegraph, too, by the side of the line. Trellis, the cross wood up which the plants grow. Tulips, full blown, what a beautiful show! Tea-party, given as Teacher's kind Treat; With Table, Tray, Teapot, and Teacups so neat. Trunk, the great Tree that the woodmen cut down For Timber to build that great house in the Town. Turnpike, a Toll-gate across the high road. Throne, for the monarch: Tusk, Tiger, and Toad. Thistle, a weed, very prickly and rank. Thyme, the sweet plant that we found on the bank. Trumpet, an instrument, loud, and so clear. Torch, that, to light them at night, the men bear. Traveller - see how he sits on the stile: Perhaps he's been walking for many a mile. Top - when you 're older, I'll buy one for you. Tongue - it should speak what is loving and true.","U begins Urn, that at tea-time Jane brings, When we all love to hear how it hisses and sings. Also Umbrella, that kept us so dry When the heavy rain poured from the black angry sky. Union - how strong, in the picture we see, Where five men, united, pull down that great tree. Union-jack, the famed flag of our land. Usher, the second at school in command. Unity, what we so love and approve -  Brothers with sisters, all dwelling in love. Umpire, one picked from the wisest and best, To settle disputes when two persons contest. Untaught, like too many we see every day. Uncommon, the singular, out-of-the-way. Uzzah, who, heedless of what God had said, And touching the ark with rash hands, was struck dead. Underwood - bushes that grow among trees. Uncle - a fine romp I had on his knees. Up - a good word in our memory to keep, When we wake in the morning, refreshed from our sleep.","V begins Van, such as last Whitsuntide, Took out our school class for a day ride: Viaduct, too, the arched road, high and strong, On which our good horses went trotting along. Village, the cluster of houses we passed: And so we arrived at the common at last. Vesture - sometimes made of Velvet - a dress. Vanity, pride in the things we possess. Vine, whose ripe grapes we all think such a treat. Vessel, that holds our spring-water, so sweet. Violin, Vincent is learning to play, (He finds it not easy, I venture to say).

Vase, a large pot used for holding our flowers. Verandah, that shelters from sunshine and showers. Vagrant, who strays without home in the land. Volume, a hook, such as this in your hand.","many a Word does W begin; As Water-wheel, Walnut, Wheat, Wheelbarrow. Win.

Windmill, whose great sails but rarely stand still. Wagon - the team has just come up the hill. Well, that supplies us with Water to drink. Willow, that droops by the cool river's brink. Wasp, veiy fond of a plum or a peach. Wreck - a sad sight, lying there on the beach. Wallflower, that blossoms so fragrant in spring. Wren - you should see him - the tiniest tiling!

Wisdom, that Solomon asked of the Lord, Above greatest things that the World could afford.","There are so few words that begin with an X, To find them would any poor writer perplex; And so, if you please, as the X for TEN stands, We'll give you, in rhyme, God's ten solemn commands: Worship the Lord God, thy Maker, alone; And bow not to idols of wood or of stone. Speak not God's name without reverence and awe, Or He will reprove thee for breaking this law. Remember the Sabbath, of all days the host: Work six, keep the seventh for worship and rest. Honour thy parents, if thou wouldst live long. Thou shalt not kill, with the sword or the tongue. Avoid thoughts and actions unclean or impure. Beware that thou steal not, although thou be poor. Thou no false witness 'gainst any shalt bear, Nor covet thy neighbour's more bountiful share.","Y begins Yule-log, blazes so bright; Bound which cottars sit, cold Christmas night. Yew, a long-lived, and dark shadowy tree, That often in old country churchyards we see. Yacht, a small vessel, so nice for a sail; That skims like a bird, in a favouring gale. Gay Yellow-hammer, a sweet lively bird. York, of whose Minster most people have heard. Yoke, that connects those two oxen, so strong. The lad in the picture is leading along. Yeoman, an officer, well known at court, Yarmouth, a place to which bathers resort. Yarrow, a weed that we find in the fields. Yam, a nice root that America yields. Yawl, a ship's boat. that we saw on the shore, The day that papa took us all to the Nore. ""Yes,"" the dear word mamma said, as she smiled, When I asked, with a kiss, if she loved her fond child? Youth, life's short morning, that soon will be o'er: Oh waste not the hours that will come back no more. the last letter, but seldom we need, As you will discover, when books you can read.","Z begins Zenith, the sky overhead, Where shines the pale moon, as we lie in our bed.

Zechin, a coin that at Venice they use. King Zedekiah, who reigned o'er the Jews. Also Zoological Gardens, where Ned One day went to see the wild animals fed.

241,"Take your choice!, or, A peep at my playmates",1822,"From A, the great Leader, to Z in the rear, The names of “OUR SCHOOL-BOYS” shall quickly appear; The characters too, we shall faithfully tell, Of those who act BADLY and those who act WELL; That all little boys an example may take, To copy the GOOD and the BAD to forsake.","B is BOB BOOBY,—how sulky his look ! Whom nobody loves, for he loves not his book ; When call’d, by the Usher, to spell or to read, He whimpering cries, “ I don’t know it indeed!” The rod and fool’s cap he has had in their turn, But Bob seems resolved that he never will learn.","C is CHARLES CAREFUL, whom none can surpass. So clever, he’s now at the head of our class ; So dutiful, kind, and obliging beside, The joy of his friends, of his parents the pride ; His worth to proclaim, and his person to deck, A Medal of Merit he wears at his neck.","D is DO-LITTLE, who scarce knows a letter, Yet willing to learn, he soon hopes to Do better ; Intent on his lesson he sits by himself, And heeds no impertinent mischievous elf; We love the fine fellow, and, eager to tell Our friendly affection, we call him Do-well.","E is TOM EASY, whom nothing annoys, But who with mere trifles his time oft employs. One day in our school, as he play’d with the Cat, The Usher demanded,—”Tom, what are you at?” In lack then of speech, poor Tom Pussey cried Mew,” Tom Easy I mean,” said the Usher, ” not You J”","F is FRANK FRETFUL,—the boys love to tease him, So peevish and cross, there is nothing can please him; When told of his faults, he says, ” What’s that to you?” And point but your finger, he cries “Have done, do!” While around him we caper and cheerfully sing, He blares like a Calf in the midst of the ring!","G is GEORGE GOSSIP, a tale-bearing youth. Delighting in fibs, and regardless of truth ; His schoolfellows dread him, and, seeing him come. Each lifts up a finger, and all exclaim “Mum !” For when with his tales he thinks fit to begin, He dashes away, through thick and through thin.","H is HAL HARDY, all danger he scorns: He seized a fierce Billy-Goat once by the horns, Which, rearing, had threaten’d to give Hal a fall, And seem’d much inclined to wage war on us all:— “Cry Quarter” said Hal:—the goat could not obey, But he sprang from his victor, and scamper’d away.","I is young IDLER, whom here you may see, And his name and his character strictly agree; At school he’s the last, coming in,—going out, The last in whatever the boys are about: If so he continue, ’tis easy to tell The last he will be in the world to do well.","J is JEM JOLLY, the JESTER, no fool, Alert when at play and attentive at school; The life of our sports, and whose juvenile wit To each in his turn gives a palpable hit; But as none of his jokes are design’d to give pain. So none of his playmates are heard to complain.","K is KIT KINDLY, a good-natur’d creature, Whose kind disposition is seen in each feature.: His fruit or his cakes after school he’ll divide, And lay for himself the least portion aside. To all in distress his benevolence flows, And all bid ” Heaven bless him !? wherever he goes.","L, LOUIS LIVELY, of cherub-like smile, Can well of dull care all his comrades beguile; At home or abroad, in our school, or at play, He’s affable, friendly, good-humour’d and gay ; Yet sometimes most gravely this lad takes the chair, And settles disputes like a Judge or Lord Mayor !","M is MARK MEANWELL, severe in reproof, From whom Master Gossip had long kept aloof; George wore a black clolce that was losing its dye, Mark offer’d a substitute then to supply, A black of firm jet, that would strike all beholders, ‘What’sthat?’ Throw your character over your shoulders!","N is NED NOVICE, who seems to take pains In aiming at wit, yet a Novice remains; Do-little in silence long bore his abuse, “You dare not,” said Novice, “cry Boh ! to a goose.’ “I dare though,” Do-little replied, and to show His courage, he look’d in Ned’s face and cried, Boh !","O is young OLIVER ODD-ONE, when foil’d Ned Novice at wit, by Do-little the child, A donkey was browsing apart from two others,— ” See,” Ned said to Oliver, ” one of your brothers. Or one of your family ranging the sod on !” ‘How so?’ ‘Why,’ cried Ned, ‘don’t you see he’s an odd-one.","P, PETER PEEVISH,—no patience has he, But scalds both his mouth and his throat with his tea, Then picks with his fingers the crumbs from the loaf, And cries, when reproved, like a great silly oaf: At home or at school, let him be where he will, Poor Peter is peevish and petulant still.","Q is the QUERIST, who runs from his task, Some foolish and frivolous question to ask: ‘What’s your name? what’s the hour? which way shall you go? What toys have you got ? what tales do you know ?’ But ah! the enquirer, now jeer’d by each scorner, Is order’d to stand like poor Q, in a corner.","R, ROGER RANDOM, who dashes away, Still heedless of what he may think, or may say. A Rhymist is Roger; ” Observe now this rule,” Our Usher once said, ” Every Poet’s a fool.” Indeed, sir ! said Bob, I dont happen to know it; But one thing I know, every fool’s not a poet.”","S is SAM SOP,—see how hungry his look! From morning to dinner-time teazing the cook ; He fell in the dripping once. Oh ! how he squall’d ! Now what is the matter?” his frighten’d Aunt bawl’d; “Why, nothing at all, Ma’am,” the Cook thus began, “A Trifle,—’tis only a SOP in the pan!”","T is TIM TRUSTY, a fault on himself Who took, to screen Do-little, panic-struck elf; And Trusty well flogg’d then was order’d to be, “Oh, don’t, cried the culprit, ’twas me! it was me!” Tim Trusty the Master’s high favour thus gain’d, And Do-little too a free pardon obtain’d.","U is young USURY, his money who lends On Cent per Cent gain to his playmates and friends; Who two-pence to-day will permit you to borrow, Provided that four-pence you pay him to-morrow;— But to lend without int’rest he’s never inclined, For no generous feeling exists in his mind,","V, VICARY VAINLOVE, a genius who owes His self-estimation alone to his clothes; Urigifted by worth, against merit a railer, He trusts for regard to the skill of his Tailor. “Your pride let this bird,” said our Usher,” subdue, The peacock GOD made, but a Tailor made you!”","W, WISEBOY with pleasure I greet, For with knowledge no doubt such a youth is replete. In reading, in spelling, in using the pen, And casting up figures, he’ll equal some men ; Nay of grammar itself he knows every rule,— So you see he’s an honour indeed to our school.","X is our XERXES,—a Captain we boast, Who like his great namesake might head an armed host; This honour denied, we yet yield to his rule, Commander in Chief of the Boys of our School, ; He marshals our ranks, and he measures each pace, And puts us about to the right and left face.","Y is the YAWNER, the School there’s no peace in, He stares in each face, gapes and y-a-w-ns without ceasing; “The rod,” cried the Usher, ” I’ll thrust down your maw, Shut your mouth ! ” ”Yes, I will, sir, yaw-a-a-yaw!” The Usher then y-a-w-n’d, and the Boys all y-a-w-n’d too, Gape, Reader, and try,—so perhaps then may you!","Z, ZACHARIAH the ZANY stands fast, His post in the Alphabet train is the last. “The last did you say I” cried the mirth-loving Zany, “I’ll prove it the first and most honour’d of any.” THE ZANY’s TALE Pat Murphy, resolving a guinea to spare, Once ventur’d a bet on the plains of Kildare, That Zany my namesake, a favourite horse, Would gain all the honours, that day, of the course, But Zany was distanced and last in the race; “By the Powers! ” cried Pat, still maintaining his case, “The honours are won, here he comes in terrorem— Young Zany,—and drives all the racers before him.” So Z still aspires your favour to claim, For Zeal without him could not boast of a name.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

267,The world at home ABC : an alphabet of nations,1903,"A for the Arab. He lives in Arabia and in North Africa. He is a tall, noble-looking man, frank and bold, but hot-tempered and revengeful. He dwells in tents, and with his flocks and herds moves from place to place, just as his forefathers did in Bible times. His beautiful white horse is tenderly cared for; but his greatest treasure is his camel, on which he journeys across the burning sandy plains. The camel is rightly called “ the ship of the desert.” He can travel long distances without water, and he will live on coarse salt shrubs that any other creature would turn up its nose at. If a stranger comes to an Arab’s tent and asks for food and shelter, he is always gladly received and well treated. The Arab is a follower of the prophet Mohammed, and at the time of prayer, wherever he may be, he spreads his carpet, and turning his face to the holy city, says his prayers very devoutly.","B for Briton. Though his home is in little isles set in a northern sea, you will find him in every part of the world, for he is never so much at home as when he is abroad. He is strong and hardy, dogged and brave, just and generous, and a lover of fair play. He belongs to a nation of sailors, and wherever a ship can sail, there you will find the British flag fluttering in the breeze. Every briton is proud of the Royal Navy. To her sailors Britain owes her colonies and foreign possessions, which cover one-fifth of all the land on the globe, and include one-fourth of the world’s inhabitants. The British army, though not large, is “ready to go anywhere and do anything.” Rule, Britannia!","C for Cossack. His home-is on the wide, dreary plains or steppes of south-east Russia. His forefathers were fierce warriors who feared nothing, and loved liberty better than life itself. The Cossack is a splendid horseman, and is more at home in the saddle than on foot. He is a soldier of the Czar, and he bears hunger, thirst, cold, and fatigue without complaining. As a scout he has hardly an equal. He knows the steppe as a good boy knows his book, and can track a foe by the most trifling signs. In winter, when the land is white with snow, he sometimes has to face wolves, which are then mad with hunger. Travellers are sometimes overtaken and devoured by them. Let us hope that the men in this picture will escape such a terrible fate.","D for Dutch. Here is a Dutch girl with her little dog-cart full of milk-cans. You see how smart and neat she is ; and you need not be surprised, for the Dutch are the cleanest people in Europe, and their housewives are always busy washing, scouring, and polishi the girl you can see a canal and windmill. Everywhere the land is crossed and recrossed by canals, and everywhere you see windmills, with their great arms going round and round. In winter the canals are frozen, and then everybody skates. Men skate to their work, women to market, and children to school. The men wear short blue jackets and very baggy trousers ; and all poor people wear wooden shoes, which make a great clatter on the pavements. The Dutch are excellent farmers and good sailors. They make a great deal of cheese. The little round cheeses you see in shops come from Holland.","E for Egyptian. He lives in Egypt, the land of the pyramids. And his country would be nothing but a desert were it not for the river Nile, which makes a strip of it green and fertile. Egypt is full of ruins of pyramids, temples, and tombs, which were built in days long before the time when the Israelites were bondmen in the land. The Great Pyramid is not far from Cairo, the capital of the country. It was built five thousand years ago. It is higher than the highest spire in Europe, and there are seven million tons of stone in it. It took one hundred thousand men thirty years to build it. Beside it is a huge man-headed lion called the Sphinx. Formerly the Egyptians were badly treated by their rulers, who robbed them right and left. Now the British rule the country, and their lot is a much happier one. At one time they had to be driven to fight with whips. Now the “Gippies” are capital soldiers, and a few years ago they fought very bravely against the Dervishes side by side with British soldiers.","F for Frenchman. Fie calls his land “ Beautiful France,” and loves it very dearly. The French people have been called the “liveliest nation in the world.” They are certainly fond of plays, dancing, and music; but they are gallant soldiers as well, and, as a people, they love warlike glory. Quick and clever, they are famous for their tact, good taste, and polite manners. Paris, their capital, is sometimes called “The Gay City.” It has fine buildings, beautiful tree-shaded streets, and fine shops. One of its oldest buildings is the cathedral of Notre Dame. It is six hundred years old, and its front is a mass of fine carving. The country people are very simple and hard-working. On the coast they are fishermen, and inland there are many vine-yards. In the south part of the country there are many mulberry trees, on the leaves of which the silk-worms, which make the silk for ribbons and ladies’ dresses, are fed.","G for Greek. In ancient clays the Greeks were a strong and gifted race. Among them were some of the greatest poets, historians, speakers, and thinkers that the world has ever known. Their books are read even now in our schools and colleges. The ancient Greeks loved everything that was beautiful, and their sculptors, painters, and builders produced works which have never been excelled. In Athens, their capital, and in other places, we may see the grand old ruins of their wonderful buildings. But evil times came upon them. They lost their freedom, and at last were overcome by the Turks. Since 1822, however, they have been free, though they were badly beaten in 1897 by their old masters. The Greeks of to-day are excellent seamen and clever traders—too clever, sometimes, for they are apt to be cunning and untruthful. They are very fond of music, and of singing songs to the strains of the guitar. Most of their songs are rather sad, because many of them recall the days when the Greeks were the bondmen of the cruel Turks.","H for Hindu. In the vast country of India, which belongs to Britain, live about one-fifth of all the people in the world, and most of them are Hindus. Though they have dark-brown skins, they belong to the same family of the human race as we do. As their country is a very hot one, they do not wear much clothing; but what they do wear is very gay indeed—white, red, scarlet, orange, and yellow. Some of the native princes wear rich robes, which are studded all over with diamonds, pearls, and other precious stones. The elephants upon which they ride are covered with gold-embroidered cloths and trappings of the most costly kind. The Hindus are divided into almost countless classes, called castes; and men and women of one caste will not marry, or eat with, or visit those of another caste. It is this great disunion amongst the Hindus which enables the British to rule them. Many Hindus serve in the British army, and are fine soldiers.","I for Irishman. Ireland is the land of the colleen bawn, the broth of a bhoy, the pratie, the jaunting-car, the shamrock, the Blarney stone, the brogue, “ the gintleman that pays the rint,” the banshee, the shillalah, and Donny-brook Fair. There is nobody in all the world so gay, witty, and warm-hearted as Pat, and he will share his last crust with you gladly. And he is a rare fighter, too, and sometimes wants to know “Who’ll tread on the tail my coat ? ” Everybody loves his sister Norah, with her bright eyes, her winning ways, and her ready tongue. If you ever visit the Emerald Isle, you will have an “ illigant time, indade ! ” and when you leave it, you will long to “ Come back to Erin, mavourneen, mavour neen.” Erin go bragh ! In this picture little Pat is waiting to have some potatoes for his supper. The Irishman likes potatoes, and often poor little Pat must have them for breakfast and for dinner as well.","J for the Jap. He lives in Japan—a group of islands to the east of Northern Asia. He is a little fellow, with a sallow face and lank, black hair. When he wears his native costume, he puts on a long, loose silk robe, with a girdle at the waist, and he never goes abroad without his paper umbrella and his fan. The Japanese ladies, like ladies all the world over, delight in dress. They wear a bright-coloured undergarment of silk, over which are two or three, and sometimes five or six, flowing robes of crape or silk. All these garments, which are open at the neck, are girdled round the waist by a huge satin sash, tied behind in a large square bow. Japanese ladies are dainty little people, and are very proud of their hair, which they decorate with flowers. All the Japs are fond of music, storytelling, kite-flying, juggling, and plays. They like to resort to flower-gardens and tea-houses, where they enjoy themselves very much. They are very skilful workmen, and have trains and trams, telephones and telegraphs, men-of-war, and a parliament, just as we have. Here is a picture of the Japanese cab—the jinrikisha.","K for the Kafir. He lives in South Africa, and is a fine, tall, strong fellow, with thick lips and woolly hair. He used to be very fond of fighting, and with his assegai, his knobkerry, and ox-hide shield he has fought against British troops. Now he is peaceable, and lives in his kraal with his wives, who plant the mealies and do all the work while he lolls about smoking, palavering, and sometimes hunting. Some of the Kafirs work in the gold and diamond mines for months at a time. When they get their pay and go home again, they swagger about amongst their friends as wealthy men.Other Kafirs help the farmers to till the fields, tend the cattle, or look after the ostriches. Thousands of Kafirs have now become Christians, and have been taught trades. Most of them, however, still believe in ghosts, worship snakes, and are terribly afraid of the “witch doctor.”","L for Laplander. The Lapps are a small, hardy people, who live in the extreme north of Europe. Their land is barren and dreary, but they love it very dearly for all that. Very little will grow, so the Lapp depends upon his reindeer, just as the Arab depends on his camels. 1 he reindeer not only gives him food, drink, shelter, and clothing, but drags his boat-shaped sledge from place to place. The Lapps live in tents made of skins or coarse cloth. Dogs, men, women, and children huddle together for warmth; and when a fire is lighted you may guess how hot and stuffy the tent becomes. The “fishing Lapps” live near the Frozen Ocean. They are splendid fishermen, and even the boys can manage a canoe very well.","M for Mongol. The word “Mongol” means “brave,” and in ancient times the Mongols were the fiercest and most warlike race in the whole of Asia. Much of their country consists of a vast “sea of sand,” other parts of it are bare and treeless, but in the north-west there are some fertile valleys. Many of the Mongols are rich in flocks and herds, and these they drive from feeding-ground to feeding-ground, like the Arabs. Of course they live in tents, which are their only protection against the sandstorms of summer and the fierce snowstorms of winter. They almost live on horseback or camel-back, so that their lees are short and bent. They have flat, broad faces, dumpy noses, and eyes set at a slant. The women do all the buying and selling and much of the work, while the men enjoy themselves in hunting and hawking. Some of the best falcons in the world are to be seen amongst the Mongols.","N for Norwegian. In the picture you see a pretty Norse girl, who looks very gay in her bright holiday dress. She lives at Tromsoe, far up in the north, where the winter is very long and very cold. The summer, however, makes amends, and for weeks together the sun never sets at all, but is above the horizon all the time. Many tourists come in yachts to see the “ midnight sun ; ” and this N orse girl is ready to bid the stranger welcome, for she and her people consider friendliness a duty, and from their earliest years the children are taught to be pleasant and kind to everybody. The Norse people are of the same race as the English ; they are brave, hardy, and freedom-loving. Much of their land is bare rock, but wherever there is fertile land it is most carefully tilled. When summer comes the farmers drive their oxen, goats, and sheep to the green meadows high up the mountains. There those who look after the cattle live in rough wooden huts. In winter the cattle are brought down again to the valleys.","O for Ojibwa Indian. When Europeans first settled in North America, the “noble redskin” was the monarch of all he surveyed. Now, alas! he is fast disappearing. He is tall, straight, lithe in body, with skin of a dusky copper colour, jet-black eyes, and straight black hair. He daubs and streaks his face and body with paint, and wears a feather head-dress, a coat of deerskin embroidered with beads and quills, and has “moccasins” on his feet. He lives in a “wigwam” with his “squaw,” who carries her “papoose” in a queer bark cradle. He lives by hunting and fishing, and in his graceful birch-bark canoe he skims over the lakes and rivers at a great rate.","P for Persian. He lives in Persia, a country of Asia, and his ruler is called the Shah. The Shah has been several times to this country, so you may have seen him. The Persian is tall and graceful, with an oval face and black, glossy hair. On his head he wears a tall sheepskin hat, that looks something like a muff or a turban. Poor people wear cotton gowns and cotton trousers. The rich wear over their cotton clothes rich coats of satin embroidered with gold. The women,when they go outside their houses, are covered from head to foot with a dark cloak, and their faces are hidden by a white veil. Persians are very kind to strangers, and always try to make things pleasant for everybody. They are very quick – witted, and very kind to their children, who, in return, are very loving and dutiful, Here is a shop in the market-place of a Persian town, and two ladies in their veils are seen approaching.","q for queenslander. queensland is a large country in the east and north-east of australia. queenslanders are of two kinds— jb- – white people like ourselves; and black, or rather dark brown, people, such as the man in the picture. the blacldellow, as he is called, is a savage. he wears little clothing; he tills no fields ; he has no flocks and herds, and so he is always on the move in search of food and water. sometimes he kills birds with his boomerang, and sometimes he manages to spear a kangaroo or an opossum. the blackfellows are now dying out, and before long there will be none of them left. many of the white queenslanders live on cattle-ranches. they are fine horsemen, and with their long stock whips they manage the halfwild cattle wonderfully well.","R for Roumanian. He lives in the north of the Balkan Peninsula of Europe, and is a light-hearted and cheerful fellow, though, unhappily, he is very ignorant. Though he is a poor farmer, his land grows much wheat and maize, which are exported to other countries. He also rears large numbers of sheep, cattle, pigs, and horses. He is now independent, but for many years his land was ruled by the Turks. PI is national dance, called the Hora, is a sort of play representing the way in which he won his freedom. The dancers first move forward in pairs, then the men and women separate, and the men dance round in a great ring, while the women wander round as if seeking for some one they have lost. Presently the men draw close together and make a “tramp, tramp” with their feet like soldiers marching. Next they gather in a crowd and imitate fighting. At last they give a loud shout of joy to show that the battle is won. Then the women run and join their partners, and the dance concludes with merry romps and gay laughter, to show that war is over at last, and Roumania is free and happy once more.","S for Spaniard. He lives in “ Sunny Spain,” which is one of the most interesting countries of Europe. As a rule, he is ignorant and cruel, but he has very noble manners. This Spaniard is a bull-In every town there is a large circus with seats one above the other, on which thousands of people sit every Sunday afternoon to watch the so-called sport. The bull is driven into the arena; then, on horseback, men armed with lances stab the creature to make it angry. The narrow escapes of these men make the crowd very excited. Then the bull-fighter appears, and the bull dashes towards him, head down. A quick leap, and the bullfighter is out of the way of the sharp horns, while the bull goes crashing by. Again and again the bull is tricked, until at last, as the animal charges him, the bull-fighter steps aside and plunges his sword up to the hilt between the victim’s shoulder-blade and spine. The bull falls dead, and the bull-fighter bows to the audience, who show their delight by waving handkerchiefs and shouting lustily. Bullfighting is a disgusting pursuit, and we may be glad that it is not permitted in our country.","T for Turk. He lives in Turkey and in the south-west of Asia. He is brave and intelligent, but very lazy, and only likes work when he can get somebody to do it for him. He loves to sit cross-legged on a low sofa or “ divan,” smoking a “ hookah ” and drinking coffee. Many Turks now dress as we do, except that they wear a red cap or fez, but at home they dress like the man in the picture. Their women seldom go out of doors, and when they do they cover up their faces with veils. Indoors, howvere, they wear gay dresses. All the household work is done by slaves. The ruler of Turkey si the Sultan. He is a very bad ruler, and treats his Christian subjects very badly indeed. Turkey is the most backward country in Europe, and some people think that the Turks ought to be driven out of Europe altogether.","U or United States, the land of the “Stars and Stripes,” a vast and wealthy country of North America. Though the United States has only been an independent country for one hundred and twenty-seven years, it has already left most European countries far behind, and bids fair, some day, to lead the world. Nature has given “ Brother Jonathan” the richest country on the globe, and he has made such good use of Nature’s gifts that the U nited States is now the land of the “ almighty dollar,” and million-V J ; aires abound. Everything across “the herring pond” is on a big scale, and in many things Brother Jonathan claims to “lick creation.” Long may the Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes wave peacefully together! The Falls of Niagara, the most wonderful waterfall in the world, lie between the United States and Canada.","V for Venetian. He lives in Venice, a beautiful city of Italy. Venice is sea-born. It is built in the sea, and has the sea for its streets and highways. Its palaces, temples, and houses are built on seventy-two islands; and there are about one hundred and fifty canals, including the Grand Canal, which is more than two miles long. It is bordered by marble palaces and crossed by several splendid bridges, the most beautiful being that of the Rialto. There are no cabs, omnibuses, drays, wagons, or vans in Venice. Instead of these the Venetians have black boats called gondolas, in which they glide about to do their shopping, visiting, church-going, and sight-seeing. The gondoliers sing as they row their boats along, and the strains mingle pleasantly with the ripple of the water. Above all is the clear blue sky, and the dazzling sunlight is reflected on the red-brown sails, of the quaint vessels.","W for West Indian. Most of the people who live in the West Indies are negroes, with coal-black faces, woolly hair, and teeth like ivory. Their forefathers were brought as slaves to these islands to work in the sugar plantations. Notice the basket on the woman’s head. It contains bananas, pine apples, oranges, and other tropical fruits, which all grow splendidly in the West Indies. There are great sugar plantations in the islands ; and when the canes are ripe the little nigger boys and girls grow very fat, for they may be seen sucking the juice out of a sugar-cane all day long. Some of the West India Islands belong to Britain, and the negroes and negresses sing “God save the King! ” just as Britons do. Many of the islands are very beautiful indeed. Richly clothed in evergreen forests, they spring out of the sparkling blue waters, gleaming like ocean gems in the brilliant sunlight.","X for the Cross of St. Andrew, which stands for Bonny Scotland. The Crosses of St. Andrew and St. Patrick are united with the Cross of St. George to form the Union Jack, the national banner of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The Cross erf St. Anelrew is a a blue ground ; the Cross of St. Patrick, which stanels for Sweet Erin, is a red cross on a white ground; and the Cross of St. George, which stands for Merry England, is a red cross on a white ground.","Y for Yoruba man. He lives in the British part of West Africa. As you see, he is a negro. But look at his hair. Instead of growing smoothly, as ours does, it grows over his head in little tufts, like peppercorns. The man in the picture has just speared an antelope, and very proud he is of the feat. Sometimes he goes fishing and sometimes he hunts the hippopotamus and the elephant. His land is full of india-rubber trees, and when rubber is wanted, he taps the trees by making a cut in the bark from the root to the lowest branch, and various other cuts running from it at right angles. Then down the long cut runs the sap, which drips into a calabash. When this is filled, it is placed over a fire, the heat of which causes the liquid rubber to thicken, and thus become ready for trade. The Yorubas must not be called savages, and are skilful blacksmiths, brass, leather, and glass workers, weavers, and canoe builders.","Z for Zulu. The Zulus are the most interesting of all the Kafirs. They are strong and well-built, and many ot them are over six feet in height. Their hair is thick and woolly, their foreheads are high, their eyes are bright, and they carry themselves with great dignity. Usually they clothe themselves in ox-hides, leopard-skins, and blankets, but their cup of joy is full if they can dress up in the old red coat of a soldier. They are a very warlike people. Under their chief Cetewayo they fought against the British, who were well armed and well trained, yet could not conquer them for quite a long time. Amongst those who were killed in this Zulu War was the Prince Imperial, son of Napoleon the Third. At the time of his death he was serving as an officer in the British army.- Many of the Zulus still live in tribes, and have villages of beehive-shaped houses. They are now quite peaceable, and do most of the heavy work in the mines and on the farms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
