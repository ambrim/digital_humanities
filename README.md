Votes for “LGBTQIA+” and “Mental Illness” combined account for less than 5% of all votes, while “Racial / Ethnic identity” and “Socioeconomic status” together account for almost half of all votes. While the study lacks data which may explain why this is, one possibility is that sexual identity and mental illness have held negative connotations through history, while socioeconomic status and racial identity have been popularized and perhaps have gained social acceptability over the past century. Other factors such as the limited history of the LGBTQIA+ acronym, which was first termed in the 1990s and have evolved to become more inclusive, and the vagueness of how one’s “socioeconomic status” could be portrayed in children’s literature also influence the trends in this analysis, but for lack of more data, they are omitted in these regressions.
